You are an insurance agent tasked with analyzing insurance data to predict the expenses incurred by policyholders. Your goal is to use this analysis to understand the factors that contribute to higher insurance costs and to help set premiums accordingly.
In the dataset you have the following features: 
uid: A unique identifier for each policyholder.
sex: The gender of the policyholder. 
bmi: Body Mass Index of the policyholder. 
children: The number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.
smoker: Indicates whether the policyholder is a smoker. 
weight: The weight of the policyholder. 
height: The height of the policyholder. 
birth_year: The birth year of the policyholder. This feature should be used to calculate the age of the person, as age is more relevant for predicting expenses than the birth year.
has_car: Indicates whether the policyholder owns a car.
favorite_color: The favorite color of the policyholder.
region: The geographical region where the policyholder resides. 
expenses: The target variable. It represents the insurance expenses incurred by the policyholder. This is what you are trying to predict.
